# 🗺️ A Map Of Memories (AMOM)

*Where every place tells a story, and every memory finds its home on the map.*

## 🌟 What is AMOM?

**A Map Of Memories** is more than just a web application, it's a digital canvas where your life's moments come alive through geography. Imagine being able to pin your most cherished memories to the exact locations where they happened, creating a personal atlas of your experiences that you can revisit, share, and treasure forever.

Whether it's that perfect sunset in Santorini, your first date at a cozy café, a family gathering at grandma's house, or an adventure in the mountains, AMOM transforms these precious moments into an interactive, visual journey through your life.
